THE BLESSED DAMOZEL.

The blessed damozel leaned out
 From the gold bar of Heaven;
Her eyes were deeper than the depth
 Of waters stilled at even;
She had three lilies in her hand,
 And the stars in her hair were seven.

Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,
 No wrought flowers did adorn,
But a white rose of Mary's gift,
 For service meetly worn;
Her hair that lay along her back
 Was yellow like ripe corn.

Herseemed she scarce had been a day
 One of God's choristers;
The wonder was not yet quite gone
 From that still look of hers;
Albeit, to them she left, her day
 Had counted as ten years.

(To one, it is ten years of years.
 . . . Yet now, and in this place,
Surely she leaned o'er me—her hair
 Fell all about my face. . . .
Nothing: the autumn fall of leaves.
 The whole year sets apace.)

It was the rampart of God's house
 That she was standing on;
By God built over the sheer depth
 The which is Space begun;
So high, that looking downward thence
 She scarce could see the sun.

It lies in Heaven, across the flood
 Of ether, as a bridge.
Beneath, the tides of day and night
 With flame and darkness ridge
The void, as low as where this earth
 Spins like a fretful midge.

Heard hardly, some of her new friends
 Amid their loving games
Spake evermore among themselves
 Their virginal chaste names;
And the souls mounting up to God
 Went by her like thin flames.

And still she bowed herself and stooped
 Out of the circling charm;
Until her bosom must have made
 The bar she leaned on warm,
And the lilies lay as if asleep
 Along her bended arm.

From the fixed place of Heaven she saw
 Time like a pulse shake fierce
Through all the worlds. Her gaze still strove
 Within the gulf to pierce
Its path; and now she spoke as when
 The stars sang in their spheres.

The sun was gone now; the curled moon
 Was like a little feather
Fluttering far down the gulf; and now
 She spoke through the still weather.
Her voice was like the voice the stars
 Had when they sang together.

(Ah sweet! Even now, in that bird's song,
 Strove not her accents there,
Fain to be hearkened? When those bells
 Possessed the mid-day air,
Strove not her steps to reach my side
 Down all the echoing stair?)

‘I wish that he were come to me,
 For he will come,’ she said.
‘Have I not prayed in Heaven?—on earth,
 Lord, Lord, has he not pray'd?
Are not two prayers a perfect strength?
 And shall I feel afraid?

‘When round his head the aureole clings,
 And he is clothed in white,
I'll take his hand and go with him
 To the deep wells of light;
We will step down as to a stream,
 And bathe there in God's sight.

‘We two will stand beside that shrine,
 Occult, withheld, untrod,
Whose lamps are stirred continually
 With prayer sent up to God;
And see our old prayers, granted, melt
 Each like a little cloud.

‘We two will lie i'the shadow of
 That living mystic tree
Within whose secret growth the Dove
 Is sometimes felt to be,
While every leaf that His plumes touch
 Saith His Name audibly.

‘And I myself will teach to him,
 I myself, lying so,
The songs I sing here; which his voice
 Shall pause in, hushed and slow,
And find some knowledge at each pause,
 Or some new thing to know.’

(Alas! We two, we two, thou say`st!
 Yea, one wast thou with me
That once of old. But shall God lift
 To endless unity
The soul whose likeness with thy soul
 Was but its love for thee?)

‘We two,’ she said, ‘will seek the groves
 Where the lady Mary is,
With her five handmaidens, whose names
 Are five sweet symphonies,
Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen,
 Margaret and Rosalys.

‘Circlewise sit they, with bound locks
 And foreheads garlanded;
Into the fine cloth white like flame
 Weaving the golden thread,
To fashion the birth-robes for them
 Who are just born, being dead.

‘He shall fear, haply, and be dumb:
 Then will I lay my cheek
To his, and tell about our love,
 Not once abashed or weak:
And the dear Mother will approve
 My pride, and let me speak.

‘Herself shall bring us, hand in hand,
 To Him round whom all souls
Kneel, the clear-ranged unnumbered heads
 Bowed with their aureoles:
And angels meeting us shall sing
 To their citherns and citoles.

‘There will I ask of Christ the Lord
 Thus much for him and me:—
Only to live as once on earth
 With Love,—only to be,
As then awhile, for ever now
 Together, I and he.’

She gazed and listened and then said,
 Less sad of speech than mild,—
‘All this is when he comes.’ She ceased.
 The light thrilled towards her, fill'd
With angels in strong level flight.
 Her eyes prayed, and she smil'd.

(I saw her smile.) But soon their path
 Was vague in distant spheres:
And then she cast her arms along
 The golden barriers,
And laid her face between her hands,
 And wept. (I heard her tears.)
