—Mr Brandes places it as the first play of the 
closing period, Stephen said.
—Does he? John Eglinton said. What does Mr 
Sidney Lee or Mr Simon Lazarus as 
some think his name is, say of that play?
—Marina, Stephen said, child of seastorm, 
Imogen, ______________, Miranda, a 
childish wonder, Perdita, that which 
was lost. That which was lost in 
youth is reborn strangely in his wane 
of life: his daughter's child. But 
who will love the daughter if he has 
not loved the mother? I don't 
know. But will he not see in her 
recreated and with the memory of his 
own youth and his own image added to her the images 
which first awakened his love?
_____Do you know what you are 
talking about? Love, yes word known to all men. Amor vero 
aliquid alicui bonum vult unde 
et ea quae concupiscimus …….
—A man with that queer thing genius above all whose own 
image is to him, morally and 
materially, the standard of all 
experience. He will be touched 
by that appeal or he will be 
infallibly repelled by images of 
other males of his brood in 
whom he will see grotesque 
attempts on the part of nature 
to foretell or to repeat himself.
