Welcome to Juxta!

In getting started, you should download and read the PDF user's handbook located in the "help" section of the Juxta home page:

http://www.patacriticism.org/juxta/

You can learn a good deal about the tool from this "welcome.jxt" comparison set.  It contains two versions of the text you're reading now.  Clicking on words and phrases highlighted in blue reveals variants.  You can explore Juxta by experimenting with other buttons and fields, such as the comparison view of documents or the command for generating a critical apparatus.

You can also examine some sample collations that we have prepared for you.  Just select "Open Sample..." from Juxta's "File" menu.  Any of the .jxt files contained therein will provide you with a playground for learning how Juxta works.

When you are ready to collate your own documents, ready them according to directions in the user's manual and choose "New Comparison Set" from the "File" menu.

Have fun -- and good luck!
