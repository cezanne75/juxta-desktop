<m_s id="3e8" type="s" n="1" />The blessed damsel leaned against
The silver bar of Heaven.
Her eyes knew more of rest and shade
Than a deep water, even–
She had three lilies in her hand
And the stars in her hair were seven.<m_e refid="3e8" />

<m_s id="2f9b8" type="s" n="2" />Her robe, ungirt from clasp to hem,
No wrought flowers did adorn,
But a white robe of Mary's gift
For service meetly worn;
And her hair lying down her back 
Was yellow like ripe corn.<m_e refid="2f9b8" />

<m_s id="5cc60" type="s" n="3" />Herseemed she scarce had been a day
One of God's choristers;
The wonder was not yet quite gone
From that still look of hers;
Albeit to them she left, her day
Had counted as ten years.<m_e refid="5cc60" />

<m_s id="89f08" type="s" n="4" />(To one it is ten years of years.
. . . . . Yet now, and in This place,
Surely she leaned o'er me,—her hair
Fell all about my face.
Nothing: the autumn fall of leaves: 
The whole year sets apace.)<m_e refid="89f08" />

<m_s id="ba478" type="s" n="5" />It was the rampart of God's house
That she was standing on;
By God built over that sheer depth
The which is Space begun;
So high, that looking downward thence,
She scarce could see The Sun.<m_e refid="ba478" />

<m_s id="e8e90" type="s" n="6" />Heard hardly, some of her new friends,
Playing at holy games,
Spake gentle-mouthed among themselves
Their virginal chaste names;
And the souls mounting up to God
Went by her like thin flames.<m_e refid="e8e90" />

<m_s id="118078" type="s" n="7" />And still she bowed herself &amp; stooped
Into the vast waste calm,
Till her bosom's pressure must have made
The bar she leaned on warm,
And the lilies lay as if asleep
Along her bended arm.<m_e refid="118078" />

<m_s id="145ed8" type="s" n="8" />From the fixt lull of Heaven, she saw
Time like a pulse shake fierce
Through all the worlds. Her gaze still strove
Within that gulf to pierce
The swarm; and then she spake, as when
The stars sang in their spheres.<m_e refid="145ed8" />

<m_s id="17a6b0" type="s" n="9" />“I wish that he were come to me,
For he will come,” she said.
“Have I not prayed in Heaven?— on earth,
Lord, Lord, has he not prayed?
Are not two prayers a perfect strength?
And shall I feel afraid?<m_e refid="17a6b0" />

<m_s id="1ab3f0" type="s" n="10" />“When round his head the aureole clings
And he is clothed in white,
I'll take his hand and go with him
To the deep wells of light,
And we will step down as to a stream
And bathe there in God's sight.<m_e refid="1ab3f0" />

<m_s id="1dc518" type="s" n="11" />“We two will stand beside that shrine,
Occult, withheld, untrod,
Whose lamps are stirred continually
With prayers sent up to God;
And see our own prayers, granted, melt
Each like a little cloud.<m_e refid="1dc518" />

<m_s id="20c2b8" type="s" n="12" />“We two will lie i' the shadow of
That living mystic tree
Within whose secret growth the Dove
Is sometimes felt to be,
While every leaf that His plumes touch
Saith His name audibly.<m_e refid="20c2b8" />

<m_s id="238d90" type="s" n="13" />“And I myself will teach to him—
I myself, lying so,—
The songs I sing here, which his voice
Shall pause in, hushed &amp; slow,
And find some knowledge at each pause,
Or some new thing to know.”<m_e refid="238d90" />

<m_s id="267b90" type="s" n="14" />(Alas! just now, in that bird's song,
Strove not her accents there
Fain to be hearkened? When those bells
Possessed the midday air,
Was she not stepping to my side
Upon a silver stair?)<m_e refid="267b90" />

<m_s id="295608" type="s" n="15" />“We two,” she said, “will seek the groves
Where the lady Mary is,
With her five handmaidens whose names
Are five sweet symphonies;—
Cecily, Gertrude, Magdalen,
Margaret and Rosalys:<m_e refid="295608" />

<m_s id="2c20e0" type="s" n="16" />“They sit in circle, with bound locks
And brows engarlanded;
Into the fine cloth white like flame
Weaving the golden thread
To fashion the birth-robes for them
Who are just born, being dead.<m_e refid="2c20e0" />

<m_s id="2f0ee0" type="s" n="17" />“Herself shall bring us hand in hand
To Him round whom all souls
Kneel, the unnumbered ransomed heads
Bowed with their aureoles;
And Angels meeting us shall sing
To their citherns and citoles.<m_e refid="2f0ee0" />

<m_s id="3204b0" type="s" n="18" />“There will I ask of Christ the Lord
Thus much for him and me:—
Only to live ats once on earth
At peace, — only to be
As then awhile, for ever now
Together, I and he.”<m_e refid="3204b0" />

<m_s id="3498d8" type="s" n="19" />She gazed and listened, and then said,
Less sad of speech than mild:
“All this is when he comes.” She ceased:
The light thrilled past her, filled
With Angels in strong level lapse.
Her eyes prayed, and she smiled.<m_e refid="3498d8" />

<m_s id="37e0b0" type="s" n="20" />(I saw her smile.) But soon their flight
Was vague in distant spheres.
And then she laid her arms along
The shining barriers,
And laid her face between her hands,
And wept. (I heard her tears.)<m_e refid="37e0b0" />
